               Hey cutie,
<Br><Br>
Thanks for being my Valentine. 
<Br>
Initially I thought just asking you to be my Valentine is enough and that'll take care of itself, I honestly had no idea what to do next. Then the Sunday after Valentine's Day, on the 16th of February I had the idea to make this for you with one intention. I had no clue how to make a website so on the bus back from church I watched tutorials and I started immediately after getting back to uni.
<Br><Br>
But I still had exams and I was making it secretly while staying in Ram's and Mughi's room, so progress was slow. During the first week of palap it was quite chill and I had some time to continue working on this. And progress continued slowly, even until today with a few tweaks here and there. And there is a little Easter egg for you to find here<Br>(no clues for you).
<Br><Br>
You are beautiful, bright, smart, you're also funny <Br>(funniest person I know btw),<Br> you know how to express yourself, and so much more, but also super cuteee. I have known you for nine years, and have always admired you for your hard work, but it's only after leaving school and being away from everyone that I noticed how much you mean to me, that admiration turned into adoration. Initially I didn't understanf those feelings and tried to brush it off. But it has never gone away in the years after leaving school. I figured I noticed it too late, but somehow no matter how much I try to hide it, by some conspiracy, you found out how I feel for you. And because of that I have been writing about you and these feelings for you. 
<Br><Br>
Thank you for everything Cutie.

With all that being said, here's the most important part
