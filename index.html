                Hi cutieee,
                <br> 
                I am really sorry for lying to you yesterday, it won't happen again.
               <br> But this website which is a letter is, in fact for you, and your pretty eyes only.
               <br> It's really simple but i took wayyy too long to complete this,
               <br> sooo i really hope to hear from you.
            </p>
